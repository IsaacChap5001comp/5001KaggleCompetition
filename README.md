Hi, welcome to my submission attempts to the 2022 Kaggle competition adapted by HKUST MSBD programme.
Here, you will find my code used for the pneumonia prediction competition. 
The key model used are random forest, logistics regression and linear regression. 
You can also find code that plots out each feature against the label.
It has reached a good accuracy of 96%.
